the time is 13:45 ,the learning carrys on at section 4. 

whether we find a joke funny or not largely depends on were we have been 
brought up. the sense of humour is mysterious bound up with national 
characteristics. A Frechman ,for instance,might find it hard to laught 
at a Russian joke. in the same way, a Russian fail to  see anthing amusing
in a joke which would make an Englishman laugh to tears.sick
